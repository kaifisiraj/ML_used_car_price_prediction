This project aims to predict the selling price of cars using different features of the car. The model created will help customers understand how the prices of cars vary based on the different features. It can also help management and customers understand the dynamics of the used car market. The data was split into two parts for training and testing purposes. 70% of the data was used for training the machine learning model, while the remaining 30% was used for testing its accuracy. Four machine learning models were tested and compared to find the one with the highest accuracy. However, a limitation of this project is that it used a relatively small number of records for the analysis.
